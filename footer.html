
Here's a basic HTML footer template that you can use as a starting point for your website's footer. You can customize it with your own content and styling as needed:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Website Title</title>
    <!-- Add your CSS links and other head elements here -->
    <style>
        /* Add your CSS styles for the footer here */
        footer {
            background-color: #333;
            color: #fff;
            padding: 20px 0;
            text-align: center;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your website content goes here -->

    <footer>
        <div class="container">
            <p>&copy; 2023 Your Website Name. All rights reserved.</p>
        </div>
    </footer>

    <!-- Add your JavaScript links and other scripts here -->
</body>
</html>
In this template:

The footer is enclosed within a <footer> element.
We've added some basic styling to the footer, setting its background color to a dark gray (#333), text color to white (#fff), and providing some padding for spacing.
You can replace "Your Website Name" with your actual website name or copyright information.
You can also include links to social media profiles, additional contact information, or any other content you want to display in the footer.
Make sure to include this footer template at the bottom of each HTML page on your website to maintain a consistent footer across all pages. You can also link external CSS and JavaScript files as needed for further customization and functionality.
